# Dynamic Accounting Graphs library
This Python code supports the research project, Dynamic Accounting Graphs, written by Ben Avery on 31st August 2024.
The research project was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the MSc in Machine Learning and Data Science of Imperial College London.
The code contained in this library was written by Ben Avery, unless otherwise stated.

The main scripts are contained in the 'src' folder.

Unit tests for the main scripts are contained in the 'tests' folder.

Jupyter notebooks for reproducing the experimental results and figures from the research project are contained in the 'paper' folder.

An example of how to use the code to train a model is in the Jupyter notebook, 'example_usage.ipynb', in the root directory.

All the scripts and notebooks assume that the PythonPath includes the 'src' directory.
